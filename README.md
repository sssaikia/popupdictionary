## What is it?
This is an android app to quickly look up the meaning of any word, using the android context menu. Tap and hold any selectable word, like in an article or a news website, the android context menu will appear, along with "copy" "paste" there you will see an option "meaning", tap it, now the meaning will be displayed in a popup. 

## How?
It searches the definition of any input text, in google. Eg- define <text>
  
## why?
This app was created out of frustration, because similar apps in PS are either too big, packed with useless features or asking to pay to use the full app. Non of them satisfied me, so I made one for myself, exactly what I wanted. App was developed in a very short period fo time, and was for personal use, so it doent't look very fancy, but it works, which is why I thought of sharing it. Source is totaly open, go crazy. Thanks.
